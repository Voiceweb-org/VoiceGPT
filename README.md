# VoiceGPT

We believe ChatGPT is a kind of browser of the semantic web. Instead of traditional hyperlink interactions, it responds to user inquiries, absorbing the entire knowledge accumulated from the internet and integrated into its expansive language model. Consequently, users can access the entirety of the internet's information solely through ChatGPT, making it an effective interface for comprehensive internet information. 

It has begun offering plugins, suggesting its evolution towards a multi-agent system (MAS), capable of executing actions. Yet, it remains fundamentally a form of browser. Further iterations like AutoGPT or AgentGPT aim to enhance ChatGPT's functionality, positioning it under their umbrella, potentially evolving into next-generation web browsers.

We are in the process of constructing a similar system, utilizing open-source large language models. 
However, our approach will diverge significantly from the methods employed by ChatGPT, AutoGPT, and AgentGPT.

## Key Features

* Voice-First Interaction: VoiceGPT is designed to be conversational with a primary emphasis on voice-enabled interaction.
* Action-Oriented: The primary focus of VoiceGPT is to execute actions, particularly in interacting with smart IoT devices.
* Fresh Content: VoiceGPT is not a closed system. It allows users to surf the traditional internet and receive timely updates.
* Open System: VoiceGPT allows any plugins to register, maintaining an open, uncensored environment. 
  It facilitates connections beyond just plugins, enabling human interactions as well.
* Cross-Platform: VoiceGPT can be installed on any device, ranging from PCs and mobile devices to smart IoT embedded devices.
* Customizability: As an internal module, VoiceGPT supports customization in various styles and languages. 
  Businesses can customize their own VoiceGPT according to their unique utterance preferences.
  

# Use of VoiceGPT
VoiceGPT is envisioned as the cognitive core of robots or voice-first smart IoT devices. 
However, its adaptability extends to installation on personal devices such as smartphones or computers.
