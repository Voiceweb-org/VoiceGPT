# VoiceGPT
We believe ChatGPT is a kind of browser of a semantic web. You don't need to interact with it by clicking hyperlinks, instead you just need to ask it. The ChatGPT has already absorbed all the knowledge of the internet and trained it into a large language model. So, when you use it, you don't need to use any other websites, with only ChatGPT you are able to use all the information of the internet. So, ChatGPT is an interface of the whole information Internet. Now, it also starts to provide plugins, which means the ChatGPT is going to become a MAS(multi Agent System), it's able to do actions. Meanwhile, it's still a kind of browser. The AutoGPT or AgentGPT is trying to make the ChatGPT do more things by putting ChatGPT under it. It looks like they are also going to become next generation web browser.

We are going to build a similar system by using open source large language model. Meanwhile, we are different with ChatGPT, AutoGPT and AgentGPT. 

## The key points include the following

**1. The VoiceGPT is voice based, which means it's conversatonal, but it will focus on voice enabled interaction.**

**2. Actions. VoiceGTP is going to do actions, most focus on interacting with smart Iot Devices.**

**3. Updates. It will not be a restricted system, people are going to use it surfe traditonal internet and get updates.**

**4. Openness. Any plugins are able to be registered on it, meanwhile it will havs no censorship.**

**5. Cross Platform. This means it will be able to installed any any devices, like PC, mobile and Smart IoT embeded Devices.**
